Verification Environment for D Flip-Flop | SystemVerilog

Developed a complete SystemVerilog-based testbench to verify a D Flip-Flop DUT, including interface, transaction class, generator, driver, monitor, and scoreboard components.
Utilized mailbox-based communication for synchronization between testbench components.
Implemented a randomized transaction class to generate diverse input stimuli, achieving 95% functional coverage.
Designed a robust scoreboard to perform output checking and ensure functional correctness of the DUT.
Verified the design using EDA Playground, demonstrating a thorough understanding of UVM-like verification methodology.
